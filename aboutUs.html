                                <h4>A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Indian spiritual teacher and the founder-acharya (preceptor) of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).
                                </p>
                                 <p> Abhay Charan Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada was born in a Hindu family on
                        September 1, 1896. He was growing up in the British-ruled India. After a few years, he
                        joined the civil non-cooperation movement started by Mahatma Gandhi for the freedom.
                        After that, he met a well-known religious leader and scholar, Shri Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
                        Saraswati Thakur in 1922. The influence of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati’s philosophy
                        proved to be a milestone in Abhay Charan’s life. He told Abhay Charan to introduce the
                        philosophies of Lord Krishna in the west. In 1933, he became a follower of Srila
                        Bhaktisiddhanta. Later, he spent 32 years of his life in the preparation of his journey
                        to the western countries to obey his guru’s wish.

                        At the age of 69, he started his journey to New York City with only 40 Rs in his pocket
                        and a trunk full of books and some of his personal belongings on a cargo ship,Jalduta.
                        The journey proved to be treacherous, and he suffered two heart attacks while on the
                        ship. After 35 days at sea he finally arrived at a lonely Brooklyn port.

                        In New York he faced great hardships, and was regularly without money and a steady place
                        to live. He began his mission humbly, giving classes on the Bhagavad-gita in lofts in
                        the Bowery (New York’s infamous skid row), and leading kirtan (traditional devotional
                        chants) in Tompkins Square Park. His message of peace and goodwill resonated strongly
                        with the hippie community and younger generation, some of whom came forward to become
                        serious students of the Bhakti-yoga (loving devotion to God) tradition. With the help of
                        these people, he rented a small piece of land and registered his organization
                        officially. On 11th July 1966, he established the ISKCON or International Society for
                        Krishna Consciousness formally.


                        In the next 11 years, he circled the entire world around 14 times. He conveyed the
                        teaching of Lord Krishna to countless people in 6 different continents. A huge number of
                        men and women from different backgrounds moved to him. With the help of his followers,
                        he established several centers and projects of ISKCON in the different corners of the
                        world. Under the shadow of his motivation, followers of Lord Krishna established various
                        rural communities, temples, educational institutes and started the biggest relief
                        program on vegetarian food. With the wish to cultivate better roots of Lord Krishna in
                        India, Srila Prabhupada came back to India. Here, he opened numerous temples. He opened
                        the largest centers of ISKCON in the holy towns of Mayapur and Vrindavana.

                        The most imperative contribution of Srila Prabhupada is conceivably his books. He wrote
                        more than 70 volumes on the tradition of Krishna. All the volumes are highly appreciated
                        by the scholars because of their depth, clarity, and faithfulness towards the tradition.
                        His work has been used by several colleges in the form of textbooks as well. His books
                        have been already translated into 76 different languages. His most appreciated and
                        famous works include ‘Bhagavad Gita As It Is’, 30-volumes of ‘Srimad Bhagavatam’, and
                        17-volumes of ‘Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita’.

                        His achievements are innumerable, magnificent and extraordinary. Srila Prabhupada’s most
                        significant contributions, perhaps, are his books. He authored over 70 volumes on the
                        Krishna tradition, which are highly respected by scholars for their authority, depth,
                        fidelity to the tradition, and clarity. Several of his works are used as textbooks in
                        numerous college courses. His writings have been translated into 76 languages. His most
                        prominent works include: Bhagav
                        ad-gita As It Is, the 30-volume Srimad-Bhagavatam, and the 17-volume Sri
                        Caitanya-caritamrita.
                        Some of his achievements are listed below:
